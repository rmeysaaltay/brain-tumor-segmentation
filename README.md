ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Segmentation

This project is a **medical image segmentation system** using **YOLOv8** and **Gradio**.
It allows users to upload medical images and get predictions about brain tumor segmentation.
I developed this project as my first project during my summer internship.

   Features
- YOLOv8-based segmentation model
- Easy-to-use Gradio web interface
- Outputs detailed detection results with confidence scores
